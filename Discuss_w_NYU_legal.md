## Items to discuss with Eric and Mark from Legal

### Dr. Bharath Modayur - wants small business approval to use Databrary

- Firm: Launch Bottle (http://www.launchbottle.com/)
- completing NIMH funded studies
- IRB: E&I (http://www.eandireview.com/), 
- Dr. Modayur:PI and the person at Launch Bottle that can sign off on the Databrary agreement.  
- was last left that Eric and Mark Righter were going to discuss the issue in July of last year. 

### NIH approval?

- There are people at NIH that want to be authorized, but there are issues (I don't know what exactly). Is this related to legal or NIH?
